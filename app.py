                Underlying the RFM segmentation technique is the idea that marketers can gain an extensive understanding of their customers by analyzing these three quantifiable factors:

                - **Recency**: How much time has elapsed since a customer‚Äôs last activity or transaction with the brand? Activity is usually a purchase, although variations are sometimes used, e.g., the last visit to a website or use of a mobile app. In most cases, the more recently a customer has interacted or transacted with a brand, the more likely that customer will be responsive to communications from the brand. 
                - **Frequency**: How often has a customer transacted or interacted with the brand during a particular period of time? Clearly, customers with frequent activities are more engaged, and probably more loyal, than customers who rarely do so. And one-time-only customers are in a class of their own. 
                - **Monetary**: Also referred to as ‚Äúmonetary value,‚Äù this factor reflects how much a customer has spent with the brand during a particular period of time. Big spenders should usually be treated differently than customers who spend little. Looking at monetary divided by frequency indicates the average purchase amount ‚Äì an important secondary factor to consider when segmenting customers. """)
